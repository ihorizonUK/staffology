            you provided when you requested the report
        content (Union[Unset, None, str]): [readonly] This could contain a link to a PDF file, HTML content or other
            content, depending on the Type value.
        model (Union[Unset, P11]): A P11 Report summarises payments and deductions made to an employee.
            Our Reports API can return this to you in many formats including as a PDF file
